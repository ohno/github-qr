# GitHub:QR

This is an unofficial QR code generator for GitHub profiles and projects. You must follow [GitHub's guidelines](https://github.com/logos) to use. This page was developed by [Shuhei Ohno](https://github.com/ohno/) and designed by [ezeroms](https://ezeroms.com/about/). Some icons are provided by [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/icons). The background is based on [Bubble Float](https://codepen.io/alphardex/pen/jOWMGON) from [Animated Backgrounds](https://animatedbackgrounds.me/). This project depends on [QR Code Styling](https://github.com/kozakdenys/qr-code-styling) by [Denys Kozak](https://github.com/kozakdenys). More options are available [here](https://qr-code-styling.com/). Are you rich? You can [buy me a coffee](https://github.com/sponsors/ohno).
